            <p style="color: mediumblue">  My name is Cole Diamante. I'm a 17 year old guy who enjoys all things video games.
                 I started playing videos games when I was around 5 on the Playstation 2. Since then my  passion for
                 video games has only grown stronger. I've decided I wanted to get into Video Game  Design, because 
                 video games is one of the few things that I've been passionate about all my life.I was born on May 21st 2003 in Rhode Island, and still live there. I enjoy fishing, swimming, playing 
                 video games, and building computers. I've had many pets over the years, but my only current pet is my 
                 dog, Coco who is a Bichon-Poodle mix. Once I have a goal in mind, I try my very best to achieve it.</p>
