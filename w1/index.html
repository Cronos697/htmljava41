    <img src="imgs/me.jpg" alt="Image of me">
    <p>My name is Cole Diamante. I'm a 17 year old guy who enjoys all things video games.
        I started playing videos games when I was around 5 on the Playstation 2. Since then my passion for
        video games has only grown stronger. I've decided I wanted to get into Video Game Design, because 
        video games is one of the few things that I've been passionate about all my life.</p>


        <P> I was born on May 21st 2003 in Rhode Island, and still live there. I enjoy fishing, swimming, playing 
            video games, and building computers. I've had many pets over the years, but my only current pet is my 
            dog, Coco who is a Bichon-Poodle mix. Once I have a goal in mind, I try my very best to achieve it.</P>
